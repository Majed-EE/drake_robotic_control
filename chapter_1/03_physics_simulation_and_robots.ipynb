The **IIWA14** is a 7-DOF industrial robot arm from KUKA. Drake includes many robot models that you can load directly from Drake, which is what we will do in this part. You can find a full list of the available Drake models [here](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/models).\n\n**YOUR TASK:** Load and visualize the IIWA14 robot using Drake's physics engine.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- `Parser`: Loads robots or assets described with robot description files (like URDF/SDF/MJCF) files into the physics engine\n- `MultibodyPlant`: Drake's main physics simulation engine for robots and objects. This will be the backbone for all of our simulations.\n- `SceneGraph`: Drake's module for handling everything related to registering robot and object geometries, handling geometry queries, collision detection, etc.\n- **Base Welding**: Fixing the robot base to the world frame is important so it doesn't fall!\n\n**Reference:** For this part, we will closely follow the [Drake Simulation example](https://deepnote.com/workspace/Drake-0b3b2c53-a7ad-441b-80f8-bf8350752305/project/Tutorials-2b4fc509-aef2-417d-a40d-6071dfed9199/notebook/simulation-1ba6290623e34dbbb9d822a2180187c1) from [Chapter 2](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/robot.html) from the class textbook - in this part we will follow the **\"Simulating the (passive) iiwa\"** and **\"Visualizing the scene\"** sections closely.

These skills will be essential for the more advanced topics later in the class, as well as for your class project!\n\n**Next:** In Notebook 3, you will learn how to quickly assemble complex scenes using a `scenario.yaml` file and `HardwareStation`.","block_group":"55f9849a1696444a884845cb4db8ca42"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a style='text-decoration:none;line-height:16px;display:flex;color:#5B5B62;padding:10px;justify-content:end;' href='https://deepnote.com?utm_source=created-in-deepnote-cell&projectId=6e32ce10-e406-4026-abfb-00be78c478cb' target=\"_blank\">\n<img alt='Created in deepnote.com' style='display:inline;max-height:16px;margin:0px;margin-right:7.5px;' src='data:image/svg+xml;base64,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' > </img>\nCreated in <span style='font-weight:600;margin-left:4px;'>Deepnote</span></a>","metadata":{"created_in_deepnote_cell":true,"deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0,"metadata":{"deepnote_notebook_id":"5ffad489d2fd41d29d0408949a9095c9"}}
